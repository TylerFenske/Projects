## ABOUT:
This project was created for a class at UNM (CS351 Design of Large Programs). All code was written by me, Tyler Fenske, and all images were created by a friend (David Crum) for the purpose of this project.

## HOW TO USE PROGRAM:
GameCoordinator is the entry point class for Remi_Tile. There are no command
line arguments. Simply run the game from GameCoordinator or the included .jar
file, and begin playing.

## DEBUGGING FLAG:
In the display class, you may change the public variable showComputerCards to 
true before running the program. This will show the computer's hand while 
playing the game.

## KNOWN ISSUES:
There are no known bugs at this time. 

## GAME RULES:
Game rules are listed in the program itself. Simply press the "Game Rules" 
button at any point during execution for a comprehensive explaination of the 
rules.
